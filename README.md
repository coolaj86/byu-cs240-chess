Chess program for BYU CS240 2010 Winter semester.

Please don't cheat by trying to use my project.
I believe that they automated diff program which diffs against past semesters as well.

Add `-Werror` and fix warnings.

This probably won't get done since this was just a school project and serves little purpose now.
